  "Nestled in London's leafy suburb of Arnos Grove, Arnos Park is a small but much-loved public park and playground with a rich history. While the park is owned by Enfield council, the friends of Arnos Park are a committee of hardworking volunteers who make sure that the park can continue to be enjoyed by its community by putting on events that go towards the upkeep and betterment of the park. Volunteers are always welcome but if you just want to come along to one of our events, or just head to the park for a stroll, we look forward to seeing you there.";
